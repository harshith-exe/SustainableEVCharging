This code snippet controls a servo motor based on readings from two Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs). The servo motor's position is adjusted to maintain balance between the LDR readings, facilitating potential applications in automation and control systems.

The provided code is a part of a larger project aimed at optimizing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations through the integration of renewable energy sources, specifically solar and wind energy.

The code demonstrates the control mechanism for adjusting the position of a servo motor based on readings from two Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs). The servo motor is used to control an actuator or mechanism in the charging station.

The broader project focuses on designing and implementing a hybrid smart solar and vertical windmill system tailored for generating clean energy to power EVs. This innovative system aims to maximize energy production efficiency while addressing the intermittency issues associated with individual renewable energy sources.
